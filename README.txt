Dataset consists of reddit posts of >20 words grouped by subreddit and score (positive or negative).

I've included three notebooks: 
hillary classifier
donald classifier
topic model

I suggest viewing them in that order. There's a bit at the end of the donald classifier file that takes code from the topic model file, so skip to topic model file if you're confused about that. 

The code in the Hillary and Donald classifier files looks almost the same because i used the same method to create the classifier. Most of the comments are in the Hillary file I believe. However the figures are different.

I've also included the file I used to scrape and clean the data, if that is of interest.
